# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Social-Media-Using-Ensemble-Learning
Sentiment analysis is a critical component of natural language processing (NLP). It helps convert unstructured textual data into actionable insights by classifying opinions. The project's primary challenge was to process noisy, unstructured data from social media and apply machine learning models effectively.
**Libraries:**
1. NLTK for tokenization and stop word removal.
2. Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
3. Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
4. XGBoost for gradient boosting.
5. emoji for handling emojis in text.
**â€¢ Techniques:**
1. TF-IDF Vectorization for converting textual data into numerical features.
2. Random Forest for bagging-based ensemble modeling.
3. XGBoost for boosting-based ensemble modeling.
4. Voting Classifier for combining predictions from Random Forest and XGBoost.
